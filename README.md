# Digital Logic Projects in Verilog
Logic Circuit Fundamentals
Digital circuits and related terminology, design abstractions and design methods, implementation technologies, and digital system descriptions.

Combinational Logic Circuits
Combinational logic circuits: definitions, representations, and minimization methods

Combinational Building Blocks
Combinational building blocks: Multiplexors, Decoders, Shifters, and Encoders

Structural Verilog for combinational circuits
Structural Verilog for combinational circuits

Circuit Delays and Glitches
Changes to logic gate input signals ('0' to '1' or '1' to '0') can only cause logic gate outputs to change after some amount of time has passed. This module examines the effects of that time delay.

Latches, Flip-flops, and Registers
Fundamental electronic memory circuit design and application

Counters, Clock Dividers, and the Seven-Segment Display
Sequential components including counters and registers, and their applications

Arithmetic Circuits - Adders and Multipliers
Arithmetic circuits like adders, subtractors, and multipliers are essential to computing circuits. This module presents the design and application or arithmetic circuits.

Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
An introduction to Arithmetic and Logic Units

State Machine Design
